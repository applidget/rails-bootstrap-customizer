# Rails Bootstrap customizer

This is a really basic rails app allowing to quicly be able to customize twitter bootstrap. 

There are ways to customize bootstrap : 

- Official website: **but** this is not easy to see what you are doing
- Bootstrap live customizer: A lot better but there is no easy way to go back and forth between your code and the website

We created this app to quickly be able to see the results of bootstrap customization right from your PC.
